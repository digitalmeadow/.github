# Digital Meadow

Our approach to software is considered and minimal.

We prioritise stability, readability and maintability and achieve this through a low-level approach.

## Technologies

Our low-level approach leans heavily on the following technologies:

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org)

[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

[Native Web APIs
](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web#web_technology_references)

[WebGL (WebGPU)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)

Our low-level approach minimises excessive tooling. Here are the few carefully considered tools in our tool-belt:
